    <p>OUR PHILOSOPHY </p>
    <p>At Rice & Noodles and Sprout, we believe that food should be fresh, flavorful, satisfying, uncomplicated and should convey the chef’s love of cooking. Our chefs prepare authentic Vietnamese foods such as fresh spring rolls, french bread sandwiches, entrée salads, soups, rice platters and a variety of noodle dishes. We also offer a large selection of homemade desserts including French macarons, che and flan. We are a 3rd generation Vietnamese eatery that uses fresh and local ingredients. Our mission is to be Lancaster’s choice for simple Vietnamese cuisine for our guests and their families. We are proud to provide a casual, relaxing and fun atmosphere. Fresh food, high energy and honest, friendly service are the keys to our success. We want to be the pioneer and the catalyst that opens the taste palates of those who have never experienced authentic Vietnamese cuisine at reasonable prices.
