<p>
<span id="your-name-output"></span> the Cat loves pizza!
<span id="your-name-output"></span> the Cat LOVES parties TOO!
<span id="your-name-output"></span> had an idea of what we could do!
We would have the Perfect Pizza Party!
<span id="your-name-output"></span>'s friends all arrived. It was time to build the Perfect Pizza together. That would make the pizza even better!
</p>
<p>
<span id="your-name-output"></span> thought the perfect pizza topping would be <span id="food-one-output"></span> with extra cheese.
<span id="adjective-two-output"></span> Alligator said, "<span id="food-one-output"></span> would be just fine. But I really love <span id="food-two-output"></span> on mine."
<span id="your-name-output"></span> and the gang were puzzled. "<span id="food-two-output"></span>?"
</p>
<p>
<span id="adjective-three-output"></span> Squirrel said "<span id="food-one-output"></span> and <span id="food-two-output"></span> would be just fine, but I really love <span id="food-three-output"></span> on mine!"
Well, that's something new. But maybe <span id="food-three-output"></span> could be groovy too!
<p>
"Its a party, a party, a <span id="food-one-output"></span>, <span id="food-two-output"></span>, <span id="food-three-output"></span>, pizza party!"
Trying something new might be FUN! They all built up the courage to take a first bite. The Pizza was out of sight!! But... <br> </p>
In the end, the Perfect Pizza is a pizza shared with friends.

<h1>The End! </h1>
