    <p>This is a link to a really interesting wiki article about the average <b> color of the universe: </b> </p>


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte" target="_blank"> Cosmic Latte Wiki</a>

<p>And here's a quote from the article about how they chose the name:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
Though Drum's suggestion of "cappuccino cosmico" received the most votes, the researchers favored Drum's other suggestion, "cosmic latte". "Latte" means "Milk" in Italian, Galileo's native language, and the similar "Latteo" means "Milky", similar to the Italian term for the Milky Way, "Via Lattea". They enjoyed the fact that the color would be similar to the Milky Way's average color as well, as it is part of the sum of the universe. They also claimed to be "caffeine biased".
